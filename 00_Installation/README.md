## Setup and Installation Instruciton for the Workshop

For the commands shown, `%` (and anything to the left of it) represents the
terminal prompt. You do not need to copy it; instead only copy the command to the
right of `%`.

If you already have conda installed, you will just need a new environment following these commands:
conda create -n jwebbinar python=3.8
conda activate jwebbinar
pip install jdaviz
pip install jwst


## Install Miniconda (if needed)

*Miniconda is a free minimal installer for conda. It is a small, bootstrap
version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend
on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few
others. Note, though, that if you have either Miniconda or the full Anaconda
already installed, you can skip to the next step.*

In a terminal window, check if Miniconda is already installed.

    % conda info

If Miniconda is not already installed, follow these instructions for your
operating system: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html.
Please be sure to install a **64-bit version** of Miniconda to ensure all packages work correctly.
