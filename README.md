## Description

This workshop is intended to give observers an in-person, hands-on introduction to JWST data analysis and visualization tools within the Python ecosystem. The event is ideal for beginners wanting to work with the upcoming JWST Cycle 1 data, including the >1000 hours of observations with no exclusive access period. During the workshop, we will explore the data formats from the JWST calibration pipeline, demonstrate the JDAViz tools for visualizing imaging and spectroscopic data, and give users a chance to experiment with Python workflows for different data analysis tasks. This workshop will include activities that will require users to install Python-based software and download simulated data onto their computers.
